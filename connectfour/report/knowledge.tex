Because the depth of the state space is to large to efficiently exhaust,
heuristics are needed to guide the search. Still, it proved difficult to make a
heuristic to guide the first couple moves, as the sparsely filled states leave
little to go on. For this reason we opted for a knowledge base (KB) to guide the
first few moves towards optimal paths. Concretely, we use a KB provided by John
Tromp\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/\textasciitilde tromp/}. The KB consists
of ply-8 moves which, in itself, is insufficient for expert play. The initial
guidance, leading to optimal states up to ply-8, makes it easier to find good
hueristics, as it is a lot easier to make choices with e.g. 21 coins placed than
with 5.
